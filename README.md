## Ipsum Below

Open Git Bash on your system and type the following command
 in the Git Bash; git config --global core.editor <directory
 address> Note: Notepad++.exe we put up at the end of the
 directory name. It is because it is the exe file we would
 like to get opened when we need an editor in Git. This file
 corresponds to the Notepad++ startup of the software.
